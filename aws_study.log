- Explain how to use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy web applications to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) servers in multiple Regions. 
- Explain how to use AWS CodePipeline to establish a continuous integration and
perform continuous deployment to multiple Regions.

MODULE 5: AWS AND DEVOPS DEMO



Monitoring  services
    AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing system
    Amazon CloudWatch
    AWS Config
    AWS CloudTrail 

Containers and serverless services
    AWS Lambda
    Amazon Elastic Container service (Amazon ECS)  


Infrastructure management services
    AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure-as-code service.
    AWS OpsWorks

AWS Cloud9 is Amazon's cloud-based IDE, which you can use to write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. You can use AWS Cloud9 to make code changes in a CodeCommit repository. You can also use AWS Cloud9 with the AWS specific software development kits (SDKs). 

Each stage can have a number of actions that need to be performed. 

Actions are tasks that can run in sequence or in parallel to each other. Actions are associated with a service provider that runs the action, or they can require user intervention. Service providers can be AWS services (like CodeBuild, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudFormation), or third-party services (like Jenkins and TeamCity). 
Action types include: 
    - Source (where the source is stored)
    - Build (how to build the application)
    - Test  how to test the application)
    - Deploy (how to deploy the application)
    - Approval (manual approval and notifications)
    - Invoke (Invoke a custom function).

AWS CodePipeline
    - Capture and visualize your pipeline, run it, view real-time status, and retry failed actions.
    - Automate your release processes, eliminating human error, speed up delivery, and improve the quality of the release. 
    - Establish consistency in the release.
    - Incorporate your source, build, and deploy tools.
    - View pipeline history details.
    - Integrate with third-party and AWS tools to build, test, and deploy your code when notified of a code change.

MODULE 2: DEVOPS METHODOLOGY
--- 2 ----

DevOps is a combination of:

Cultural philosophies for removing barriers and sharing end-to-end responsibility
Processes developed for speed and quality, that streamline the way people work
Tools that align with processes and automate repeatable tasks, making the release process more efficient and the application more reliable
